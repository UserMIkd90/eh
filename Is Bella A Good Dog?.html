<p> Bella has done many unjust acts in her lifetime, but this does not mean she's a bad dog. One of the more egregious accusations is that she's stolen food.

Maybe she's guilty, but should be judged by human values? In the <em> doggy world </em> stealling food is an accepted practice! </p> <p> It's a compliment!</p>

<p> I will not stand for the rampant slander spreading through the neighborhood! </p>

<p> Bella has done many noble deeds that are never mentioned. For example, she once saved a cat from prison! She also takes her humans on walks, donates weekly to marshals and TJ-maxx, scares off strangers, in <strong>her</strong> yard, and more! </p>
<p> Just like the beatles song Bella is "not guilty"!!</p>

<h5 style="color: white;"> Bella has never barked unwarranted in her life. </h5>
<p> She has only ever barked at intruders, family, and friends.</p>
